            <h2>THE STORY BEHIND THE COACH</h2>
            
            <p>
                Coach Kelvin's fitness journey began over two years ago when he discovered 
                that through dedication and hard work, he could transform not just his body, 
                but his entire life. What started as a personal challenge quickly evolved into
                a passion for helping others achieve their fitness goals.
            </p>

            <p>
                Through years of dedication, trial and error, and continuous learning, 
                Coach Kelvin developed a training philosophy that combines work ethic,
                personalized programming, and unwavering support. His approach is not just about
                physical transformation... it's about empowering individuals to take control of their
                health and fitness journey.

        <!-- Training Philosophy -->
        <section>
            <h2>THE COACH KELVIN PHILOSOPHY</h2>
            
            <h3>What Makes Our Approach Different?</h3>
            
            <p>
                At Coach Kelvin Fitness, we believe that true transformation comes from three 
                essential pillars:
            </p>

            <ol>
                <li>
                    <strong>Personalized Programming</strong> - No cookie-cutter plans. Every program 
                    is tailored to your specific goals, fitness level, and lifestyle. Your journey 
                    is unique, and your training should reflect that.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Accountability and Support</strong> - Success doesn't happen in isolation. 
                    We provide consistent check-ins, motivation, and guidance to keep you on track 
                    even when motivation runs low.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Education and Empowerment</strong> - We don't just tell you what to do... 
                    we teach you why. Understanding the science behind your training helps you make 
                    informed decisions and build lasting habits.
                </li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Train Hard, Like Haze</h3>
            <p>
                This isn't just a slogan... it's a mindset. Training like Haze means showing up 
                consistently, pushing past your comfort zone, and refusing to settle for mediocrity. 
                It means embracing the grind and trusting the process. When you train with Coach Kelvin, 
                you're not just working out... you're building the mental toughness and discipline 
                that carries over into every aspect of your life.
